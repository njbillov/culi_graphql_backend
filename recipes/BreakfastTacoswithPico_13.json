  "description": "Eggs are one of our absolute favorite ingredients. For these tacos we're going to try a quick scramble so that the eggs hold onto some texture. Adding the charred scallions to the mix deepens their flavor, and when you top it with the fresh, acidic pico, it really takes them up a notch. The pico keeps great in the fridge, and works wonders as a condiment on meats or as a salsa. ",
